# SmartBuy

Smartbuy is a website for comparing the prices of a particular product in different e-commerce websites and stores.
For example, you want to buy an iPhone. The price of iPhone would be different in amazon and apple store.
The idea was to create a website which lists the out the prices of a product in different stores and websites.

This repository was created as part of a group project for the course *User Interface Design*.

The website was created using **HTML, CSS, and Javascript**. The website uses static data from a list of javascript objects.
